I am the Founding Machine Learning Scientist at AlphaGrid, accelerating the deployment of clean energy infrastructure for a decarbonized future. I received my PhD in AI/ML (Electrical Engineering) from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, advised by <a href="http://www.engineering.unl.edu/ece/faculty/benjamin-riggan/">Dr. Benjamin S. Riggan</a>. My research addresses the following questions: 
- How can we instruct a computer to pay attention to fine-details in the image with limited/no supervision?
- How do we enable it to learn directly from the data and generalize seamlessly across diverse domains?
- How do we prioritize computing resources on challenging examples?
  
  My research focused on the application of biometrics to develop tools for identification and law enforcement, ultimately promoting public convenience and safety, supported by: <a href='http://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/briar'> IARPA's BRIAR </a> and <a href='http://artiamas.umd.edu'> Army Research Lab/UMD's ArtIAMAS </a>, that aim to advance biometric intelligence in complex environments.  
 
  In industry, I spent 3 years at <a href='http://www.tomtom.com'>TomTom Maps </a>, where I was part of the Concept Development Team to build the next generation of map-making. During my PhD, I was also part of the AI team at <a href='http://www.x.company'> (Google) X, the Moonshot Factory </a>, working on few-shot learning and photogrammetry.
