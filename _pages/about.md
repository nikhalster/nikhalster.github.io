 I'm a <u>Ph.D. candidate </u> in Electrical Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with over 7 years of research experience, advised by <a href="http://www.engineering.unl.edu/ece/faculty/benjamin-riggan/">Dr. Benjamin S. Riggan</a>. My research addresses the question: <i> <b> How to distill discriminative information across domains with minimal or no supervision, while mitigating the impact of poor generalization? </b> </i> My research is focused on the application of biometrics to develop tools for identification and law enforcement, ultimately promoting public convenience and safety, supported by: <a href='http://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/briar'> IARPA's BRIAR </a> and <a href='http://artiamas.umd.edu'> Army Research Lab/UMD's ArtIAMAS </a>, that aim to advance biometric intelligence in complex environments.  
 

  In industry, I spent 3 years at <a href='http://www.tomtom.com'>TomTom Maps </a>, where I was part of the Concept Development Team to build the next generation of map-making.  

  During my PhD, I have completed two AI residencies at <a href='http://www.x.company'> (Google) X, the Moonshot Factory </a> where I worked on cutting-edge projects involving few-shot learning and photogrammetry.
